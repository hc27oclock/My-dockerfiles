# My-dockerfiles
Listing docker files used in https://hub.docker.com/u/hc27oclock

Because I don't intend to use RStudio inside Docker, I specifically use docker hub rocker/r-ver:4 .

List of software versions I aim to use:
  - Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy)
  - R 4.2.2
  - Bioconductor 3.16
  - python 3.10 (for compatibility with umap-learn 0.5.3)
